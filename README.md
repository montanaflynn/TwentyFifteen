TwentyFifteen is my attempt to upgrade TwentyEleven. Twenty Fifteen stays true to the clean minimal approach and features updates & Improvements include better responsiveness, more page types, custom profile fields, custom meta boxes, custom post types. 

### Installation

Simply clone this repo (Using git of course) in your wp-content/themes folder and activate it. Because TwentyFifteen is a child theme you also need to have the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentyeleven">TwentyEleven default theme</a> installed. 

### TL;DR 
You can view the theme running on my website as a url <a href="http://montanaflynn.me/?theme=twentyfifteen">official demo</a>

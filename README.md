Twenty Fifteen is my attempt to upgrade Twenty Eleven, the current default WordPress theme.  It is simply a child theme based off Twenty Eleven.  Twenty Fifteen stays true to the clean minimal approach and features updates & Improvements include better responsiveness, more page types, custom profile fields, custom meta boxes, custom post types.

### Installation

Simply clone this repo (Using git of course) in your wp-content/themes folder and activate it. You also need to have the Twenty Eleven theme installed as well, while it should be there by default you can find it here: http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentyeleven

### TL;DR 
You can view the theme running on my website as a url <a href="http://montanaflynn.me/?theme=twentyfifteen">official demo</a>

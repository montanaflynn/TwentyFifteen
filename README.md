Twenty Fifteen is my attempt to upgrade Twenty Eleven, the current default WordPress theme.  It is simply a child theme based off Twenty Eleven.  Twenty Fifteen stays true to the clean minimal approach and features updates & Improvements include better responsiveness, more page types, custom profile fields, custom meta boxes, custom post types.

### Demo Website
My blog is currently running off the repo, so it serves as the <a href="http://montanaflynn.me">official demo</a>.

### To Install

Simply clone this repo (Using git of course) in your wp-content/themes folder and activate it. You also need to have the Twenty Eleven theme installed as well, while it should be there by default you can find it here: http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentyeleven

Also, I highly suggest choosing the single column layout in Appearance->Theme Options as that is what I use and have yet to account for the other layouts.

### Things To Todo:

- Responsive Menu (Something like twitter bootstrap's implementation)
	- Functional but needs refinement and testing on more devices / browsers
	- Testing in Chrome on a mac, and Android browser from a HTC smartphone.

- Author Bio Option and extra profile fields 
	- Going to start with photo, github, twitter, facebook, reddit, hacker news, linkedin, zerply, dribble and pinterest.  Suggestions welcome.

- Post / Page Specific Theme Options Via Custom Meta Boxes

- Page Templates
	- Portfolio
	- Sitemap
	- <s>Blog</s>

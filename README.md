TwentyFifteen is my attempt to upgrade TwentyEleven, the current default WordPress theme.  It is simply a child theme based off Twenty Eleven.  My blog is currently running off the repo, so it serves as the <a href="http://montanaflynn.me">official demo</a>.

##Todo:

- Responsive Menu (Something like twitter bootstrap's implementation)

- Author Bio Option and extra profile fields 

- Post / Page Specific Theme Options Via Custom Meta Boxes
